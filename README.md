# Project Overview
The India Car Price Prediction project aims to forecast the prices of cars in India, by leveraging a dataset containing essential car features such as brand, year, engine, fuletype, mileage, ownertype, and segment. The project also aims to find out the set of variables that has most impact on the car price.

# Impact
Through exploratory data analysis, several key insiaghts were discovered. Notably, there was a significant increase in car prices after the year 2010. The cars which run on Diesel have hugher price compared to petrol. Luxury German and European cars have the highest price among all segments.

For the predictive modeling, a Random forest regressor model was employed to forecast car prices. This model achieved impressive accuracy rate of 88.64%. The most important features for predicting the car price were found to be power and year of the vehicle.

This project offers valuable insights for both car buyers and sellers in India, helping them make informed decisions in a dynamic automotive market.
